# Dukkling website

This is a basic website where we describe who we are and what we do. This is not the actual app we are making.

We are making an app that keeps track of information, needs, schedules and tasks related to children. It will integrate info from other sources, automate some of the cognitive labour and divide tasks between caregivers.

As a parent we get kid-related information on at least 8 different apps and then there are messages, phone calls and e-mails, and then there are also regular mail and notes and birthday invites in the basket in kindergarten and at the bottom of backpacks. All this is incoming info, some of it needs responding or other kind of action. Then there is divvying up tasks, and reminding your partner to pick up this child at a birthday party at 8. Then there is anticipating needs, like remembering to buy winter shoes before you wake up to snow, etc. And noticing needs and taking action on them, like this child is having a rash, could it be a food allergy? And this childâ€™s water bottle has gone missing. There is also recurring stuff like football practice every Tuesday and field trip in kindergarten every Monday and somewhere between 20 and 100 little nails that need to be cut every week.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
